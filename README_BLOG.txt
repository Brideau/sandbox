For those of you interested in posting to the GeoDa Center blog, here's a short primer on how to format the text and code blocks. It's a lot easier to use this than the rich text editor provided by the blogging software. Feel free to add on, these are just the essentials.

Here's how you format the text to look like code: 

<blockcode lang="python" linenumbers="off">
import pysal as ps
import numpy as np
</blockcode>

Here's how you include a link embedded in the text:  

<a href="url">text associated with url link</a>
