GeoDa Center Code Sandbox
=========================

This project is the code repository for the 
`GeoDa Center blog <http://geodacenter.asu.edu/blog>`_. It intends to be an
archive for diverse code snippets, functions and other useful material produced
by the GeoDa Center team. This is a completely experimental space so do not 
expect the reliability and stability of other projects from the GeoDa Center for
Geospatial Analysis and Computation, such as GeoDa, GeoDaSpace or PySAL.

Checkout the blog to find more information about the code hosted here.
