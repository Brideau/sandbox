GeoDa Center Code Sandbox
=========================

This is the code repository for the 
`GeoDa Center blog <http://geodacenter.asu.edu/blog>`_. It intends to be an
archive for diverse snippets, functions and other useful material produced
by the GeoDa Center team. This is a completely experimental space so do not 
expect the reliability and stability of other projects from the GeoDa Center for
Geospatial Analysis and Computation such as OpenGeoDa, GeoDaSpace or PySAL.

The repository is organized in different folders according to the programming language used. Check out the blog to find posts that present and explain all the goodness hosted here and follow us on Twitter (`@geodacenter <http://twitter.com/geodacenter>`_) or `Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/geodacenter>`_ to stay tuned about new posts and new code. Happy hacking!!!
